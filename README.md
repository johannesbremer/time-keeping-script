# Individual Employee Payment Script
This script converts Excel tables generated by inexpensive Chinese clock-in systems into individual employee wage claims and generates monthly PDF reports.
Each PDF includes a table of all hours worked and totals for the month. The output PDF is in German, but other languages could be added with minor modifications.
If you need support for other languages or have any questions, please open an issue.
